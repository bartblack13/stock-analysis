## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with using the Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to analyze large sets of data. Since VBA requires the use of coding language, this project also served  to start building a foundation of writing and manipulating coding languages, that can hopefully translate and be applied to quickly learning other codes.  It was done as part of my Week 2 project for my DU coding bootcamp.  My work with the data set included:

* initializing variable of different types
* using loops to automatically loop through large data sets, including nested loops
* using conditional arguments
  a) "if-then" statements
  b) and/or statements
* initiallizing and using arrays and indexes to make writing and executing code more efficient
* reusing, debugging, and commenting on code
* formatting outputs
    a) fonts, interior, cell color, etc
    b) number formats
    c) conditional formatting
* creating and using:
    a) Message Boxes
    b) user input boxes
    c) creating user friendly buttons
* measuring code performance via embedded timer
* refactoring code

## Summary
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### **What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
The largest advantage of refactoring code is that a workable solution is already at hand.  This allows the code writer to easily copy and paste or even just reorganize the code to make it more efficient and cleaner.  However, I do see that it could force you into a coding strategy that might not be the easiest or the best, as you are using the pre-exisiting logic as foundation for your editing.
Another advantage is that you can make the code more efficient, allowing it to run quicker; be applied to multiple data file sets; or allow for a data set to dynamically change while still using the same code.  This gives the coder a huge advatage for time management.  If the coder can spend a bit of extra time writing a well thought out code in order to avoid writing multiple macros for similar files, then the coder has won the long game.

### **How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**
For me, the original code worked flawlessly.  It was averaging run speeds of 4-4.5sec., which is still pretty quick, but could definitely be faster, especially in todays internet based world.  I was able to refactor the orignal code as I was learning it to make ot a bit more efficient.  For example, as soon as I learned how to use an imput box, I began editing all of the "worksheet activation" codes, so that I auto populate the values neccessary to change between analysis and output sheet regardless of year.  
The down side for me was that the predetermined structure of the refactored code, pigeonholed me into trying use coding strategies that I wasn't super confortable with.  In a lot of ways, it might have been easier for me to develope my own strategy and write a lot of the code from the ground up.  This is especially true since I spent a lot of time trying edit prexisting code, make sure it was consistent, make sure it was given to me without errors or misspelled variables, etc.  Sometimes, starting from scratch is better than retooling something, regardless of the industry or application.
In the end, even with the problems that I encountered, and the disfunctional code, unable to generate correct output values, the refactored code was running aout 60% faster.  I think that given enough time and more experience, I could problem solve my exisiting refactored code to work properly and run more quickly than my original code.
